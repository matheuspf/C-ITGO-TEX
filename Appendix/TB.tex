%\subsection*{Three-bar truss design problem}

The three-bar truss design problem \citep{TB} consists in minimizing the volume of a statically loaded three-bar truss. There are two continuous design variables and three nonlinear inequality constraints, based on the stress on each of the truss members ($\sigma$), with $f(\bm{x}^*) = 263.895843$. Figure \ref{fig:TB} shows the schematic view of the problem. The full problem statement follows:
