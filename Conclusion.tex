\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}

This work presents a modified iterative topographical global optimization algorithm, denominated CI-TGO, specialized in solving constrained optimization problems. The method developed in this paper uses a custom topographical heuristic, based on a stochastic application of the three step criteria comparison, along with a space reduction procedure. In addition to being very simple conceptually, the CI-TGO algorithm is very generic in the sense that any local search procedure can be used to tackle a specific problem, be it continuous or discrete.

The CI-TGO method was compared against several algorithms found in literature, some presenting state of the art results, in eight difficult constrained engineering optimization problems. In all tests performed, the CI-TGO outperforms any competing method regarding the number of function evaluations to converge to optimal or nearly optimal solutions, with performance gain in some problems being of an order of magnitude.
