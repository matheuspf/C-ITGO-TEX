\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:Conclusion}

This work presents a modified iterative topographical global optimization algorithm, denominated C-ITGO, specialized in solving constrained optimization problems. The method developed in this paper uses a custom topographical heuristic, based on a stochastic application of the three step criteria comparison, along with a space reduction procedure. In addition to being very simple conceptually, the C-ITGO algorithm is very generic in the sense that any local search procedure can be used to tackle a specific problem, be it continuous or discrete.

The C-ITGO method was compared against several algorithms found in literature, some presenting state of the art results, in eight difficult constrained engineering optimization problems. In all tests performed, the C-ITGO outperforms any competing method regarding the number of function evaluations to converge to the best-known solution found, with performance gain in some problems being of an order of magnitude over the best performing methods compared.
