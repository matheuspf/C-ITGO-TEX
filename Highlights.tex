\begin{itemize}

\item A simple meta-heuristic specialized in constrained optimization is developed.

\item The developed method can solve real, integer and mixed-integer constrained problems.

\item State-of-the-art results are achieved on constrained engineering design problems.

\item Twenty of the best methods found in the literature are compared.

\item Several nonparametric statistical tests are performed.
