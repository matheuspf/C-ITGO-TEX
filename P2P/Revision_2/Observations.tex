\section*{Observations}

Considering that the reviewers still have some doubts about the methodology used to generate the results presented in the main paper, the authors decide to make the source code of the C-ITGO method public available, along with the logs containing the statistics of all runs executed.

The source code can be found in \href{https://github.com/matheuspf/C-ITGO}{https://github.com/matheuspf/C-ITGO}, and is under the MIT license.
