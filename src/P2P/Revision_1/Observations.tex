\section*{Observations}

We choose to change the title of the paper to better match the area of the work we have developed. The old title, ``A Constrained Iterative Topographical Global Optimization Applied to Engineering Optimization'', seems to have caused some confusion, relating our work to the area of deterministic global optimization.

As this work is more about the application of heuristics/meta-heuristics to solve real world engineering optimization problems, we preferred the new title ``A Constrained ITGO Heuristic Applied to Engineering Optimization''.
