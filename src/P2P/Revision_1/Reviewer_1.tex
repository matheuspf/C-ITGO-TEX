\section*{Reviewer \#1}


{\color{red} Along with the metaheuristic methods there exist many deterministic global optimization algorithms that allow one to find global minimum with assured predefined tolerance... However, the authors in the survey mention these methods in passing.
}\\

We included in the introduction a brief discussion of some deterministic global optimization methods cited by the reviewer \#1. Also, a comparison with some deterministic methods is made in the appendix of the paper, using the GKLS test classes \cite{GKLS}.

{\color{red} As the authors declare, for the sake of space they do not give the mathematical formulations of the problems solved, but from the pictures of optimized objects it is difficult to understand the level of complexity for the problems investigated. It would be better to present, at least, one full statement of optimization problem.
}\\

In the results section, we added the full mathematical statement for all problems, as suggested by the reviewer \#1.
