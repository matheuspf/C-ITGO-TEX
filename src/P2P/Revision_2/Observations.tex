\section*{Observations}

One thing that is worthwhile to explain is how we calculated the Mean Number of Function Evaluations (MNFEs) in this paper. We used the same formula as the criteria C3 as described in \cite{ADC}. Given a number $N$ of problems, a number $T$ of runs for a given problem, and the total number of function evaluations $fes_{i, j}$ required to reach a certain convergence criteria for the problem $i$ on the run number $j$, the $MNFEs$ is given by:

$$MNFEs = \frac{1}{n.t}\sum_{n=1}^N\sum_{t=1}^Tfes_{i, j}$$\\

For all the engineering problems, $N=1$ and $T=25$, while for each class of the GKLS problems (for all the 8 classes with 100 problems each), $N=100$ and $T=100$.
